# Eyes
## This project focuses on how CSS is used in coordination with Javascript and HTML to make an interactive and aesthetically pleasing site. This project will run as soon as the mouse moves once the page has completely loaded. The "eyes" will follow the cursor around the page. In the future, I plan to add a button onto the page in order to turn off tracking, and possibly change colors or add in designs to make a more detailed "face".
